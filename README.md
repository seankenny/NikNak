Diabetes glucometers are pretty basic things.  They take a blood sample and check the glucose readings.  In some cases, they can also check keytone readings.

Currently, the results are stored on most devices for a fixed period of time (a month or so).

There are proprietory applications that can retrieve the information from these meters but the data is difficult to get at.

This project is to allow the user to plug their meter into a UBS and to upload that data to a centralised server.  From there, this data can be combined with fitbit.com data.
